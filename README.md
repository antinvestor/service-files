This service is an openAPI 3.0 specification that defines how files are stored and accessed on ant investor products

Files belonging to ants should be stored safely and be highly accessible around the world. 
Public files will be cached appropriately while private files will be encrypted at rest. 
All files belong to a profile and can be accessed by ant admins.

## Overview
